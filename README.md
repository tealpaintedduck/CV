# Sarah Middleton
  I am a Junior Software Developer looking for my first role in the industry. Formerly in E-Commerce I have become more and more interested in making things and solving problems, and npw want to do it full time. I am an analytical thinker, who enjoys engaging with problems and applying logic and research to best achieve a solution. I'm looking for a workplace that challenges me, supports my learning, and advocates for clean code.

##Professional Skills

#####Versatility

I’m always happy to help with whatever needs to be done. At iSmash, I was given hugely varying tasks with which I previously had no experience, owing to it being a start up. From speccing our ideal ERP system, migrating the entire staff's emails, and investigating stock errors and third party SaaS bugs, to designing our marketing collateral and negotiating with overseas suppliers, I've approached each task with
an interest bordering on obsession.

#####Team Player

Working in a team is important to me, be it as a leader or team-member. I led a small team in my role at IGUK, and enjoyed finding ways to keep morale and efficiency up. At iSmash I was part of a collaborative and hands-on team, starting with only four of us and expanding to 30, making communication very important. I’ve been working in Agile teams at Makers Academy, partaking in and leading stand-ups and
retrospectives.
