# Sarah Middleton
  Junior Developer, formerly in E-Commerce. I'm looking for a workplace that challenges me, supports my learning, and evangelises clean code.

##Skills

###Ruby
- [TeemApp](https://github.com/Kyvyas/final_project) - My final project at Makers Academy. Uses Rails, HAML, PSQL, AWS, and Mapbox and Leaflet APIs. Tested with Rspec and Capybara, with tests also heavily relying on FactoryGirl and TimeCop.
- [InstaWow](https://github.com/tealpaintedduck/instagram-challenge) - An Instagram clone, built on Rails, with JQuery. Tested in Rspec and Capybara.

###Javascript
- [Taskr](https://github.com/tealpaintedduck/todo_challenge) - A ToDo list. Single page app, written in AngularJS and tested with Karma and Protractor
- [Nibblr](https://github.com/tealpaintedduck/nibbles) - I'm remaking my favourite DOS game, using HTML5 canvas, NodeJS and ExpressJS. You can play it [here](https://nibblr.herokuapp.com).

### Miscellaneous
  - I like learning new things and get obsessed easily.
  - I work super well under pressure - increasing in energy and happiness.
  - I utilise covert leadership; leading vicariously through other people.
  - I love test driving. I like doing just enough to make the test pass and then having to write another test to make the thing work. I like all the green. So much green.
