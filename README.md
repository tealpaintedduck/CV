  Formerly in E-Commerce, after conversations explaining to developers the logic behind the tools I wanted made and then weeping into my Hobnobs when they failed to deliver, I finally came to the conclusion that I needed to code. So here I am, coding.


## Code Examples

|  Project   |  About                          |
|------------|---------------------------------|
|  [TeemApp](https://teemapp.herokuapp.com)   | Final project at Makers Academy, uses Ruby on Rails, PSQL, Mapbox API       |
|  Nibbles   | Remade my childhood favourite in Javascript, using HTML5 canvas, NodeJS and ExpressJS |
|  InstaWow  | Instagram clone uses Ruby on Rails, JQuery, tested with RSpec and Capybara |
| Taskr | Simple AngularJS ToDo list, tested in Protractor and Karma |

## Technologies

|  | Strong | Know |
|------|--------|------|
| Languages | Ruby, Javascript | JQuery, CSS, HTML/HAML |
| Databases & ORMs | PSQL, ActiveRecord | DataMapper |
| Frameworks | Rails, Sinatra| AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS |
| Testing | RSpec, Capybara, FactoryGirl | Cucumber, Jasmine, Protractor, TimeCop |
| Other | Git Version Control (including Git Flow) | Waffle, Trello |


## Other stuff
  - I utilise covert leadership; leading vicariously through other people.
  - I like new things and get obsessed easily.
  - I work super well under pressure - increasing in energy and happiness.
  - I love test driving. I like doing just enough to make the test pass and then having to write another test to make the thing work. I like all the green. So much green.
