# Sarah Middleton
  I am a Junior Developer, formerly in E-Commerce. I am an analytical thinker, who enjoys engaging with problems and applying logic and research to best achieve a solution. I'm looking for a workplace that challenges me, supports my learning, and advocates for clean code.

##Skills

###Ruby
- [TeemApp](https://github.com/Kyvyas/final_project) - My final project at Makers Academy. Uses Rails, HAML, PSQL, AWS, and Mapbox and Leaflet APIs. Tested with Rspec and Capybara, with tests also heavily relying on FactoryGirl and TimeCop.
- [InstaWow](https://github.com/tealpaintedduck/instagram-challenge) - An Instagram clone, built on Rails, with JQuery. Tested in Rspec and Capybara.

###Javascript
- [Taskr](https://github.com/tealpaintedduck/todo_challenge) - A ToDo list. Single page app, written in AngularJS and tested with Karma and Protractor
- [Nibblr](https://github.com/tealpaintedduck/nibbles) - I'm remaking my favourite DOS game, using HTML5 canvas, NodeJS and ExpressJS. You can play it [here](https://nibblr.herokuapp.com).

###Learning Fanatic
  I love grappling with new challenges, both in and out of work. At iSmash, I was given hugely varying tasks with which I previously had no experience, owing to it being a start up. From speccing our ideal ERP system, migrating the entire staff's emails, and investigating stock errors and third party SaaS bugs, to designing our marketing collateral and negotiating with suppliers, I've approached each task with an interest bordering on obsession.
